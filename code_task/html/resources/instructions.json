The amount of treasure you dig up will decrease the longer you spend on an island. So you will need to decide when to leave each island to sail to a new one.\n\nWe will first show you some instructions and check to make sure you understand them (about 2 mins). If your answers to these questions incorrect, the experiment will end without payment. If your answers are correct, we will ask you for some basic demographic information and you can start the game.\n\nPlease only participate from a computer (no mobiles, no tablets) and if your screen is at least 13-inch diagonal. Also know that you will need remain in full screen mode for the entire experiment. If you exit full screen mode, there is no guarantee we can compensate you.\n\n\n\nPress space to continue"],
